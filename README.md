# Risk Analyst Internship

## Objective

The objective of the Cloud Risk Assessment Capstone Project was to assess the security posture of Georgia State University's AWS sandbox environment using cloud security tools and compliance frameworks. The goal was to identify misconfigurations, evaluate compliance with key industry standards, and present mitigation strategies to the GSU Cybersecurity Team. This experience provided hands-on exposure to Cloud Security Posture Management (Prowler) and Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (Qualys TotalCloud) tools while applying the NIST Risk Management Framework in a real-world cloud security setting. 

### Skills Learned

- Performed a full risk assessment of an AWS sandbox environment using industry-standard CSPM & CNAPP tools
- Mapped security findings to four major compliance frameworks, being: NIST 800-171 Rev. 2, NIST 800-53, ISO/IEC 27001:2013, and SOC Type II
- Created a custom 4x4 risk matrix to analyze and gauge severity and likelihood of vulnerabilities
- Developed a risk mitigation plan and schedule
- Acquired hands-on experience installing/running Prowler in AWS CloudShell using Linux CLI commands
- Identified mapping gaps in tools (like Qualysâ€™ lack of direct NIST references) and manually correlated findings to appropriate control families.
- Collaborated within a 5-member team to complete weekly deliverables and participated in remote review sessions with GSU Cybersecurity Services Team to review progress and receive feedback
- Delivered a formal client presentation including security risks, compliance status, and next steps  

### Tools Used

- AWS CloudShell: Executed CLI-based security assessments using Prowler in a browser-based Linux environment
- Qualys TotalCloud: CNAPP tool that provides deeper insight on vulnerabilities across the AWS environment 
- Prowler: Open-source CSPM tool used for compliance checks and NIST mappings
- Microsoft Teams: Weekly meetings and remote review sessions with our designated teams and client
- Microsoft Office (PowerPoint & Word): Created and delivered our 25-minute presentation to our client, as well as creating a 2 page executive summary

## Key Takeaways

This capstone internship provided practical experience in assessing cloud security risks, aligning technical findings to governance frameworks, and collaborating in a team-based, client-focused environment. It strengthened my technical confidence with AWS and cloud security tools while deepening my understanding of compliance processes and risk management in real-world cloud infrastructures.
